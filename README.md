# SmartFrezeAI
A Python simulation of a smart refrigerator system that dynamically adjusts ice production based on user behavior and environmental conditions. Using simulated sensors for ice bin weight, internal temperature, and usage patterns, the system intelligently controls ice production and visualizes real-time behavior through interactive graphs.

# What This Project Demonstrates
• Principles of IoT and smart appliance control <br>
• Sensor cycle optimization and data-driven decision-making <br>
• Adaptive control systems that respond to real-time inputs <br>
• Real-time system monitoring and visualization <br>

# Key Features
• Adaptive Ice Production: Ice output automatically scales with usage intensity <br>
• Real-Time Tracking: Monitors weight, temperature, and usage over time <br>
• Interactive Visualization: Choose from multiple graph types to explore system behavior <br>
• Modular Design: Built with reusable, extensible sensor classes <br>
